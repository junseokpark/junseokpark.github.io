A computational scientist, data scientist, or bioinformatician with expertise in computer science, skilled in developing machine learning models, designing large-scale data processing pipelines, and performing statistical analyses of next-generation sequencing and multi-omic experiments from patient cohortsâ€”ranging from single-cell to DNA and RNA sequence samples. Leveraging strong analytic thinking, I have contributed to projects ranging from cancer immunology and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis to dementia and neurodegeneration in ataxia-telangiectasia.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
