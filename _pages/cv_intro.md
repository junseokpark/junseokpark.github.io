I integrate `statistical analysis`, `machine learning`, and `computational infrastructure` to address scientific questions of critical importance. My technical expertise spans `Python`, `R`, `Java`, `SQL`, `Scala` and `data visualization`, and I have leveraged public databases such as [GTEx](https://www.gtexportal.org/home/faq#citePortal), [TCGA](https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga) and [ICGC](https://dcc.icgc.org) to generate actionable insights. I also bring hands-on experience in workflow management tools like `Snakemake`, `WDL`, version control with `Git`, and software development best practices.
