Hi! I'm Jun (Junseok Park: 박준석). I completed my MSc and PhD in bioinformatics at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in 2020. I'm currently a Research Fellow in <a href='https://hms.harvard.edu/'>Harvard Medical School (HMS)</a> and <a href='https://www.childrenshospital.org/'> Boston Children's Hospital (BCH)</a>.

During my postdoctoral fellowship at HMS and BCH, I developed `computational methods` to identify transposable element (TE) fusion transcripts in RNA sequence samples using `statistical` and `deep learning` approaches. I also developed scalable computational frameworks and analyzed the results, bridging experimental and computational research. Specifically, I developed [rTEA (RNA-based Transposable Element Analyzer)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37905014/), used machine learning to identify somatic TEs, conceived and developed [GenomeFlow](), enabling efficient processing of large datasets, and designed benchmarking genomic tools.

These projects showcase my ability to integrate `statistical analysis`, `machine learning`, and `computational infrastructure` to address scientific questions of critical importance. My technical expertise spans `Scala`, `Python`, `R`, `SQL`, and `data visualization`, and I have leveraged public databases such as [GTEx](https://www.gtexportal.org/home/faq#citePortal), [TCGA](https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga) and [ICGC](https://dcc.icgc.org) to generate actionable insights. I also bring hands-on experience in workflow management tools like `Snakemake`, `WDL`, version control with `Git`, and software development best practices.
