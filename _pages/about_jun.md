Hi! I'm Jun (Junseok Park: 박준석). I completed my MSc and PhD in bioinformatics at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in 2020. I'm currently a Research Fellow in <a href='https://hms.harvard.edu/'>Harvard Medical School (HMS)</a> and <a href='https://www.childrenshospital.org/'> Boston Children's Hospital (BCH)</a>.

During my postdoctoral fellowship at HMS and BCH, I developed `computational methods` to identify transposable element (TE) fusion transcripts in RNA sequence samples using `statistical` and `deep learning` approaches. I also developed scalable computational frameworks and analyzed the results, bridging experimental and computational research. Specifically, I developed [rTEA (RNA-based Transposable Element Analyzer)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37905014/), used machine learning to identify somatic TEs ([RetroNet](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.07.619809)), conceived and developed [GenomeFlow](https://github.com/junseokpark/genomeflow), enabling efficient processing of large datasets, and designed benchmarking genomic tools for the [SMaHT](https://github.com/junseokpark/SMaHT) project.

Aside from that, I enjoy playing soccer, riding my [Brompton bike](https://us.brompton.com/), watching airplane documentaries, hitting the gym, and savoring delicious food—minus the cheese. I absolutely love traveling, and I’ve had the chance to visit many countries. I’m a coffee enthusiast, a movie lover, a [Zelda](https://zelda.nintendo.com/) fan, and someone who enjoys meeting new people, listening to their stories, and learning about their lives. Happy to connect and collaborate, feel free to reach out!
