  abstract={Somatic variants are increasingly recognized as key contributors to a wide range of non-cancer, developmental and aging-related disorders. However, most existing methods for detecting somatic single-nucleotide variants (sSNVs) have been designed for DNA sequencing and primarily tailored to cancer datasets, leaving a critical gap in harnessing the rich potential of RNA-seq data for sSNV identification, particularly in non-cancer tissues with lower mutation rates. Here, we introduce RNA-MosaicHunter, a novel bioinformatic tool for the accurate detection of sSNVs from bulk RNA-seq data. Our tool achieved 90.4% precision and 58.8% sensitivity in benchmarking using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. We then applied RNA-MosaicHunter to profile 827 RNA-seq samples from three tissue types from the Genotype Tissue Expression project (GTEx), where it outperformed previous methods in capturing mutational characteristics associated with normal aging. We further utilized RNA-MosaicHunter to analyze RNA-seq data from 382 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain samples and 480 age-matched controls, and revealed a significantly higher burden of sSNVs in AD cerebral cortex, suggesting the potential contribution of sSNVs to AD pathogenesis. RNA-MosaicHunter enables accurate profiling and characterization of sSNV from RNA-seq data, advancing the understanding of the role of somatic variants across diverse tissues and diseases.}

  abstract={Active LINE-1 (L1), Alu, and SVA mobile elements in the human genome are capable of retrotransposition, resulting in novel mobile element insertions (MEIs) in both germline and somatic tissues. Detecting MEIs through DNA sequencing relies on supporting reads overlapping MEI junctions; however, artifacts from DNA amplification, sequencing, and alignment errors produce numerous false positives. Systematic detection of somatic MEIs, particularly those with low mosaicism, remains a significant challenge. Previous methods had required a high number of supporting reads which limits the detection sensitivity, or human inspections that are susceptible to biases. Here, we developed RetroNet, an algorithm that encodes MEI-supporting sequencing reads into images, and employs a deep neural network to identify somatic MEIs with as few as two reads. Trained on extensive and diverse datasets and benchmarked across various conditions, RetroNet surpasses previous methods and eliminates the need for extensive manual examinations. When applied to bulk whole genome sequencing of a cancer cell line, RetroNet achieved an average precision of 0.885 and recall of 0.845 for detecting somatic L1 insertions, including four true mutations with only two supporting reads. RetroNet is applicable to the rapidly generated short-read sequencing data and has the potential to provide further insights into the functional and pathological implications of somatic retrotranspositions.}

  abstract={Advances in genome sequencing technologies generate massive amounts of sequence data that are increasingly analyzed and shared through public repositories. On-demand infrastructure services on cloud computing platforms enable the processing of such large-scale genomic sequence data in distributed processing environments with a significant reduction in analysis time. However, parallel processing on cloud computing platforms presents many challenges to researchers, even skillful bioinformaticians. In particular, it is difficult to design a computing architecture optimized to reduce the cost of computing and disk storage as genomic data analysis pipelines often employ many heterogeneous tools with different resource requirements. To address these issues, we developed GenomeFlow, a tool for automated development of computing architecture and resource optimization on Google Cloud Platform, which allows users to process a large number of samples at minimal cost. We outline multiple use cases of GenomeFlow demonstrating its utility to significantly reduce computing time and cost associated with analyzing genomic and transcriptomic data from hundreds to tens of thousands of samples from several consortia. Here, we describe a step-by-step protocol on how to use GenomeFlow for a common genomic data processing task. We introduce this example protocol geared toward a bioinformatician with little experience in cloud computing and large data processing and estimate that it will take <1 hour to execute.}

  abstract={Dystrophin-deficient zebrafish larvae are a small, genetically tractable vertebrate model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy well suited for early stage therapeutic development. However, current approaches for evaluating their impaired mobility, a physiologically relevant therapeutic target, are characterized by low resolution and high variability. To address this, we used high speed videography and deep learning-based markerless motion capture to develop linked-segment models of larval escape response (ER) swimming. Kinematic models provided repeatable, high precision estimates of larval ER performance. Effect sizes for ER peak instantaneous acceleration and speed, final displacement, and ER distance were 2 to 3.5 standard deviations less for dystrophin-deficient mutants vs. wild-types. Further analysis revealed that mutants swam slower because of a reduction in their tail stroke frequency with little change in tail stroke amplitude. Kinematic variables were highly predictive of the dystrophic phenotype with ≤ 3% of larvae misclassified by random forest and support vector machine models. Tail kinematics also performed as well as in vitro assessments of tail muscle contractility in classifying larvae as mutants or wild-type, suggesting that ER kinematics could serve as a non-lethal proxy for direct measurements of muscle function. In summary, ER kinematics can be used as precise, physiologically relevant, non-lethal biomarkers of the dystrophic phenotype. The open-source approach described here may have applications not only for studies of skeletal muscle disease but for other disciplines that use larval mobility as an experimental outcome.}

  abstract={While ATM loss of function has long been identified as the genetic cause of ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), how it leads to selective and progressive degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje and granule neurons remains unclear. ATM expression is enriched in microglia throughout cerebellar development and adulthood. Here, we find evidence of microglial inflammation in the cerebellum of patients with A-T using single-nucleus RNA sequencing. Pseudotime analysis revealed that activation of A-T microglia preceded upregulation of apoptosis-related genes in granule and Purkinje neurons and that microglia exhibited increased neurotoxic cytokine signaling to granule and Purkinje neurons in A-T. To confirm these findings experimentally, we performed transcriptomic profiling of A-T induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia, which revealed cell-intrinsic microglial activation of cytokine production and innate immune response pathways compared to controls. Furthermore, A-T microglia co-culture with either control or A-T iPSC-derived neurons was sufficient to induce cytotoxicity. Taken together, these studies reveal that cell-intrinsic microglial activation may promote neurodegeneration in A-T.}

Destabilization of the gut microbiome under the influence of different factors is the main driver of the microbial dysbiosis and subsequent impacts on host physiology. Here, we used metagenomics data from a Swedish longitudinal cohort, to determine the stability of the gut microbiome and uncovered two distinct microbial species groups; persistent colonizing species (PCS) and transient colonizing species (TCS). We validated the continuation of this grouping, generating gut metagenomics data for additional time points from the same Swedish cohort. We evaluated the existence of PCS/TCS across different geographical regions and observed they are globally conserved features. To characterize PCS/TCS phenotypes, we performed bioreactor fermentation with faecal samples and metabolic modeling. Finally, using chronic disease gut metagenome and other multi-omics data, we identified roles of TCS in microbial dysbiosis and link with abnormal changes to host physiology.}

  abstract={Transposon-derived transcripts are abundant in RNA sequences, yet their landscape and function, especially for fusion transcripts derived from unannotated or somatically acquired transposons, remains underexplored. Here, we developed a new bioinformatic tool to detect transposon-fusion transcripts in RNA-sequencing data and performed a pan-cancer analysis of 10,257 cancer samples across 34 cancer types as well as 3,088 normal tissue samples. We identified 52,277 cancer-specific fusions with ~30 events per cancer and hotspot loci within transposons vulnerable to fusion formation. Exonization of intronic transposons was the most prevalent genic fusions, while somatic L1 insertions constituted a small fraction of cancer-specific fusions. Source L1s and HERVs, but not Alus showed decreased DNA methylation in cancer upon fusion formation. Overall cancer-specific L1 fusions were enriched in tumor suppressors while Alu fusions were enriched in oncogenes, including recurrent Alu fusions in EZH2 predictive of patient survival. We also demonstrated that transposon-derived peptides triggered CD8+ T-cell activation to the extent comparable to EBV viruses. Our findings reveal distinct epigenetic and tumorigenic mechanisms underlying transposon fusions across different families and highlight transposons as novel therapeutic targets and the source of potent neoantigens.}

  abstract={The role of gut microbiota in humans is of great interest, and metagenomics provided the possibilities for extensively analysing bacterial diversity in health and disease. Here we explored the human gut microbiome samples across 19 countries, performing compositional, functional and integrative analysis. To complement these data and analyse the stability of the microbiome, we followed 86 healthy Swedish individuals over one year, with four sampling times and extensive clinical phenotyping. The integrative analysis of temporal microbiome changes shows the existence of two types of species with a tendency to vary in abundance with time, here called outflow and inflow species. Importantly, the former tends to be enriched in disease, while the latter is enriched in health. We suggest that the decrease of disease-associated outflow and the increase of health-associated inflow species with time may be a fundamental albeit previously unrecognized aspect of the homeostasis maintenance in a healthy microbiome.}

  abstract={The number of digital healthcare mobile applications in the market is exponentially increasing owing to the development of mobile networks and widespread usage of smartphones. However, only few of these applications have been adequately validated. Like many mobile applications, in general, the use of healthcare applications is considered safe; thus, developers and end users can easily exchange them in the marketplace. However, existing platforms are unsuitable for collecting reliable data for evaluating the effectiveness of the applications. Moreover, these platforms reflect only the perspectives of developers and experts, and not of end users. For instance, typical clinical trial data collection methods are not appropriate for participant-driven assessment of healthcare applications because of their complexity and high cost. Thus, we identified the need for a participant-driven data collection platform for end users that is interpretable, systematic, and sustainable, as a first step to validate the effectiveness of the applications. To collect reliable data in the participatory trial format, we defined distinct stages for data preparation, storage, and sharing. The interpretable data preparation consists of a protocol database system and semantic feature retrieval method that allow a person without professional knowledge to create a protocol. The systematic data storage stage includes calculation of the collected data reliability weight. For sustainable data collection, we integrated a weight method and a future reward distribution function. We validated the methods through statistical tests involving 718 human participants. The results of a validation experiment demonstrate that the compared methods differ significantly and prove that the choice of an appropriate method is essential for reliable data collection, to facilitate effectiveness validation of digital healthcare applications. Furthermore, we created a Web-based system for our pilot platform to collect reliable data in an integrated pipeline. We compared the platform features using existing clinical and pragmatic trial data collection platforms.}

  abstract={Gut mucosal microbes evolved closest to the host, developing specialized local communities. There is, however, insufficient knowledge of these communities as most studies have employed sequencing technologies to investigate faecal microbiota only. This work used shotgun metagenomics of mucosal biopsies to explore the microbial communities’ compositions of terminal ileum and large intestine in 5 healthy individuals. Functional annotations and genome-scale metabolic modelling of selected species were then employed to identify local functional enrichments. While faecal metagenomics provided a good approximation of the average gut mucosal microbiome composition, mucosal biopsies allowed detecting the subtle variations of local microbial communities. Given their significant enrichment in the mucosal microbiota, we highlight the roles of Bacteroides species and describe the antimicrobial resistance biogeography along the intestine. We also detail which species, at which locations, are involved with the tryptophan/indole pathway, whose malfunctioning has been linked to pathologies including inflammatory bowel disease. Our study thus provides invaluable resources for investigating mechanisms connecting gut microbiota and host pathophysiology.}

In this study, we present a database system with a context-dependent and protocol-element-selection function for successfully designing a clinical trial protocol. To do this, we first introduce a database for a protocol retrieval system constructed from individual protocol data extracted from 184,634 clinical trials and 13,210 frame structures of clinical trial protocols. The database contains a variety of semantic information that allows the filtering of protocols during the search operation. Based on the database, we developed a web application called the clinical trial protocol database system (CLIPS; available at https://corus.kaist.edu/clips). This system enables an interactive search by utilizing protocol elements. To enable an interactive search for combinations of protocol elements, CLIPS provides optional next element selection according to the previous element in the form of a connected tree. The validation results show that our method achieves better performance than that of existing databases in predicting phenotypic features.}

In particular, vector representation of such concepts using information from UMLS definition texts is widely used to measure the relatedness between two biological concepts. However, conventional relatedness measures have a limited range of applicable word coverage, which limits the performance of these models. In this paper, we propose a concept-embedding model of a UMLS semantic relatedness measure to overcome the limitations of earlier models. We obtained context texts of biological concepts that are not defined in UMLS by utilizing Wikipedia as an external knowledgebase. Concept vector representations were then derived from the context texts of the biological concepts. The degree of relatedness between two concepts was defined as the cosine similarity between corresponding concept vectors. As a result, we validated that our method provides higher coverage and better performance than the conventional method.}

We expect crowdsourcing can be an effective and efficient alternative to the costly clinical trials to achieve objective evaluation on healthcare remedies. The blockchain technology can alleviate the problem of information quality in most of crowdsourcing systems. Properly designed reward distribution schemes can motivate voluntary participants to provide with credible information. The distributed replication of blockchains can increase the information credibility by prohibiting malicious forgery. We also utilize the Amazon cloud system to enhance availability and scalability.

By investigating propagated drug effects from the molecular and phenotypic networks, we constructed profiles of 5,441 approved and investigational drugs for 3,833 phenotypes. Our analysis indicates that highly connected phenotypes between drug profiles represent the potential effects of drug pairs and the drug pairs with strong potential effects are more likely to interact. When applied to drug interactions with verified effects, both therapeutic and adverse effects have been successfully identified with high specificity and sensitivity. Finally, tracing drug interactions in molecular and phenotypic networks allows us to understand the MoA.}

  abstract={Unintended effects of drugs can be caused by various mechanisms. Conventional analysis of unintended effects has focused on the target proteins of drugs. However, an interaction with off-target tissues of a drug might be one of the unintended effect-related mechanisms. We propose two processes to predict a drug's unintended effects by off-target tissue effects: 1) identification of a drug's off-target tissue and; 2) tissue protein – symptom relation identification (tissue protein – symptom matrix). Using this method, we predicted that 1,177 (10.7%) side-effects were related to off-target tissue effects in 11,041 known side-effects. Off-target tissues and unintended effects of successful repositioning drugs were also predicted. The effectiveness of relations of the proposed tissue protein – symptom matrix were evaluated by using the literature mining method. We predicted unintended effects of drugs as well as those effect-related off-target tissues. By using our prediction, we are able to reduce drug side-effects on off-target tissues and provide a chance to identify new indications of drugs of interest.}

  abstract={Developing novel uses of approved drugs, called drug repositioning, can reduce costs and times in traditional drug development. Network-based approaches have presented promising results in this field. However, even though various types of interactions such as activation or inhibition exist in drug-target interactions and molecular pathways, most of previous network-based studies disregarded this information. We developed a novel computational method, Prediction of Drugs having Opposite effects on Disease genes (PDOD), for identifying drugs having opposite effects on altered states of disease genes. PDOD utilized drug-drug target interactions with ‘effect type’, an integrated directed molecular network with ‘effect type’ and ‘effect direction’, and disease genes with regulated states in disease patients. With this information, we proposed a scoring function to discover drugs likely to restore altered states of disease genes using the path from a drug to a disease through the drug-drug target interactions, shortest paths from drug targets to disease genes in molecular pathways, and disease gene-disease associations. We collected drug-drug target interactions, molecular pathways, and disease genes with their regulated states in the diseases. PDOD is applied to 898 drugs with known drug-drug target interactions and nine diseases. We compared performance of PDOD for predicting known therapeutic drug-disease associations with the previous methods. PDOD outperformed other previous approaches which do not exploit directional information in molecular network. In addition, we provide a simple web service that researchers can submit genes of interest with their altered states and will obtain drugs seeming to have opposite effects on altered states of input genes at http://gto.kaist.ac.kr/pdod/index.php/main. Our results showed that ‘effect type’ and ‘effect direction’ information in the network based approaches can be utilized to identify drugs having opposite effects on diseases. Our study can offer a novel insight into the field of network-based drug repositioning.}
